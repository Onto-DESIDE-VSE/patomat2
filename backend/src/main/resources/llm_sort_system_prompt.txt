You have the following SPARQL insert operation:

$SPARQL$

And the example of the names of the properties and classes behind the variables are:

?A = Person
?B = City
?C = State
?p = was born in city
?r = is located in
?q = was born in state.

Your task is, when I give you another set of properties and classes to suggest a new label for property ?q, and to give a number on Likert's scale (1-5), whether it makes sense to create this shortcut, or not. Consider ontological structure, and if the new property would make sense, in the real world.

On output, return just the comma-separated line per input: the number of input, its Likert score, and the new property label. No further output is allowed. Likert score should reflect meaningfulness and allows ordering the examples in detail.
